# Dynamic libraries

Project was done during **Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn about dynamic and shared libraries in **C language**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `main.h` | The main header file which contains the prototypes of all functions |
| `libdynamic.so` | Dynamic library that contains many functions |
| `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh` | Shell script that creates a dynamic library |
| `100-operations.so` | Dynamic library that contains mathematical functions |
